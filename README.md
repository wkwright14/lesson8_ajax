### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Ajax lets clients' web pages to send and receive data from a web server, without the hassle of reloading the page. Ajax relies on a programming language and a data interchange. A user requests something and a XMLHhttpRequest objet is created. The HttpRequest is sent and processed, and then a response is created and the data is sent back to the user. The returned data is processed using JavaScript and the page content is updated. 
2. JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a syntax for rifling through and exchanging data. It is a subset of JavaScript but is ultimately independent of any programming language. JSON is simple and a common representation of data and allows communication between servers and browsers and peers. The way it is structred looks similar to other programming languages, which makes it easy to understand and use.
3. AJAX can have a lot of issues because it is growing very quickly. Javascript skills are necessary, as Ajax's complexity is always increasing. Because of their complexity, Ajax's bugs, maintenance, and testing can be difficult to keep up with. Additionally, most of the toolkits and frameworks are still in a beta phase and Ajax is still compatible with certain browsers.
